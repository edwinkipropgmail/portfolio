        <p>
          I'm <strong>Kiprop Edwin</strong>, a Junior Frontend Developer with a
          background in Physics from Meru University of Science and Technology.
          Iâ€™m passionate about clean UI/UX, writing code that works, and solving
          real-world problems through the web.

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm mentoring my siblings, watching football
          matches, or building something new with React. I love exploring new
          technologies and continuously improving my skills. I also believe in
          the power of collaboration and enjoy working with others to create
          innovative solutions.
